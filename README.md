# AIM

To write an NS2 program to observe the performance of the network with Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection.

# EQUIPMENT REQUIRED

PC System with Linux OS, NS2 software.

# ALGORITHM
STEP 1: Start the program.
STEP 2: Declare the global variables ns for creating a new simulator.
STEP 3: Set the color for packets.
STEP 4: Open the network animator file in the write mode.
STEP 5: Open the trace file and the win file in the write mode.
STEP 6: Transfer the packets in network.
STEP 7: Create the capable no. of nodes. 
STEP 8: Create the duplex-link between the nodes including the delay time, bandwidth and dropping queue mechanism.
STEP 9: Give the position for the links between the nodes.
Step 10: Set a TCP connection for source node.
STEP 11: Set the destination node using TCP sink.
STEP 12: Set the window size and the packet size for the TCP.
STEP 13: Set up the ftp over the TCP connection.
STEP 14: Set the UDP and TCP connection for the source and destination.
STEP 15: Create the traffic generator CBR for the source and destination files. 
STEP 16: Define the plot window and finish procedure.
STEP 17: In the definition of the finish procedure declare the global variables. 
STEP 18: Close the trace file and namefile and execute the network animation file. 
STEP 19: At the particular time call the finish procedure.
STEP 20: Stop the program.
